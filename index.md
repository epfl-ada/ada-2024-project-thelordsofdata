## The Call to Action

"Let me tell you, folks, **Make Hollywood Great Again**—it’s a masterpiece. Hollywood’s been around for over a century. We’re talking the biggest, highest-grossing movies in the world. Nobody does it better than us. 

But now, folks, **we’ve got a crisis.** Foreign movies—they’re coming in hot. These movies, folks, they’re not just coming for our audiences. They’re coming for our **box office,** our jobs, and, frankly, our popcorn money. It’s like the Oscars all over again—rigged!

Now, here’s the thing: Hollywood’s top people, the big shots, they’re calling me. They’re saying, ‘Mr. Trump, you’re the only one who can fix this.’ And I say, ‘You’re absolutely right.’ 

So here’s what we’re gonna do, folks. We’re smart, okay? Smarter than those guys. We’re going take a look at the data and have our experts analyse it. All the past American movies, who's buying them, Americans or foreigners, the influencing factors, everything. And we're going to use all that information to attract those foreign audiences. Huge audiences. The best audiences. 

You better believe it folks! We’re going to outshine, outclass, and outplay every single foreign competitor. **Made in America, baby.**"

Words from the former and future convicted President himself. Let's get started.

## Dataset

# Data Sources

The CMU dataset only contains information on the total revenue generated by the movie, as well as the genre and the tropes of the characters featured within each movie. In order to look at trends in domestic versus foreign revenues, we needed to supplement this data. In addition to the CMU dataset, we used both the 'Movies Box Office Collection Data' dataset from Kaggle and a custom dataset (which includes data from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers) from the following github link 'https://github.com/ntdoris/movie-revenue-analysis.git' to add the columns for production budget, domestic gross and worldwide gross. (ask Loic for rest)

# Influencing Factors

We've decided to look at the following factors:

- Date of Release (Year, Month)
- Genre
- Reviews (Audience, Critics)
- Ratings
- Budget
- Total Revenue
- Runtime

The result we want to look at is:
- Foreign revenue (gross, percentage)

## Conclusion

Hollywood has the tools, talent, and tenacity to bounce back stronger than ever. By focusing on data-driven strategies, embracing innovation, and delivering content that resonates globally, we can ensure that **Made in America** movies once again dominate the box office.

Let’s make it happen—because nobody does it better than Hollywood!
