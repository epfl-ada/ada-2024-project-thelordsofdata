"Let me tell you, folks, **Make Hollywood Great Again**—it’s a masterpiece. Hollywood’s been around for over a century, and it’s a beacon of greatness, just like me. We’re talking the biggest, highest-grossing movies in the world. Nobody does it better than us. Not France, not India, not even Canada—they’re nice, but come on.

But now, folks, **we’ve got a crisis.** A disaster, really. Foreign movies—they’re coming in hot. Bollywood and Korean dramas, so dramatic, so emotional. Japanese anime? People love it. And of course, China. These movies, folks, they’re not just coming for our audiences. They’re coming for our **box office,** our jobs, and, frankly, our popcorn money. It’s like the Oscars all over again—rigged!

Now, here’s the thing: Hollywood’s top people, the big shots, they’re calling me. They’re saying, ‘Mr. Trump, you’re the only one who can fix this.’ And I say, ‘You’re absolutely right.’ 

So here’s what we’re gonna do, folks. We’re smart, okay? Smarter than those guys. We’re going take a look at the data and have our experts analyse it. Past movies, who's buying them, Americans or foreigners, the influencing factors, everything. And we're going to use all that information to attract those foreign audiences. Huge audiences. The best audiences. And everyone will say, ‘Wow, Hollywood is back, baby!’ Believe me folks, it’s going to be **tremendous.**"

You better believe it folks! We’re going to outshine, outclass, and outplay every single foreign competitor. **Made in America, baby.**
