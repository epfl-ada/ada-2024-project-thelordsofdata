## The Call to Action

"Folks, **we’ve got a crisis.** Hollywood’s been around for over a century. We’re talking the biggest, highest-grossing movies in the world. But now, foreign movies—they’re coming in hot. They’re coming for our audiences, our **box office,** and, frankly, our jobs. It’s like the Oscars all over again—rigged!

Now, here’s the thing: Hollywood’s top people, the big shots, they’re calling me. They’re saying, ‘Mr. Trump, you’re the only one who can fix this.’ And I say, ‘You’re absolutely right.’ 

So here’s what we’re gonna do, folks. We’re smart, okay? Smarter than those guys. We’re going take a look at the data and have our experts analyse it. All the past American movies, who's buying them, Americans or foreigners, the influencing factors, everything. And we're going to use all that information to attract those foreign audiences. Huge audiences, all over the world, will watch our movies. **Made in America, baby.**

You better believe it folks! We’re going to outshine, outclass, and outplay every single foreign competitor, and **Make Hollywood Great Again!** "

Words from the former and future convicted President himself. So let's get started.

The foreign percentage steadily goes up until 2015. Then it starts going down. We need it to keep going up. The outliers were removed.

## Dataset

# Data Sources

The original CMU dataset only contains information on the total revenue generated by the movie, as well as the genre and the tropes of the characters featured within each movie. In order to look at trends in domestic versus foreign revenues, we needed to supplement this data. In addition to the CMU dataset, we used both the 'Movies Box Office Collection Data' dataset from Kaggle and a custom dataset (which includes data from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers) from the following github link 'https://github.com/ntdoris/movie-revenue-analysis.git' to add the columns for production budget, domestic gross and worldwide gross. 

Because our foreign gross represented the result we wanted to analyse, we needed to find more potentially influencing factors. We did so by web scraping from The Numbers for domestic/foreign gross, Rotten Tomatoes for reviews/plot summary, Wikipedia for country/language, and Box Office Mojo for domestic/foreign gross/ratings.


# Influencing Factors

We've decided to look at the following factors:

- Date of Release (Year, Month)
- Genre
- Reviews (Audience, Critics)
- Ratings
- Budget
- Total Revenue
- Runtime

The result we want to look at is:
- Foreign revenue (gross, percentage)

## Data Exploration

- Took inflation into consideration

# Budget
{% include budget_foreign.html %}

The budget is correlated to the foreign percentage. This correlation is statiscally significant significant since the pearson coefficient is 0.33 and the p value is less than 0.05. 

# Genre

{% include domestic_revenue_by_genre.html %}
Top: adventure, fantasy, science fiction, family film
{% include foreign_revenue_by_genre.html %}
Top: adventure, fantasy, science fiction, action
{% include genre_gross.html %}
Foreign > gross top: action, adventure, drama
{% include genre_percentage.html %}
Average, domestic > foreign, but not for fantasy, science fiction, adventure

# Runtime

# Ratings

## Conclusion

Hollywood has the tools, talent, and tenacity to bounce back stronger than ever. By focusing on data-driven strategies, embracing innovation, and delivering content that resonates globally, we can ensure that **Made in America** movies once again dominate the box office.
