"Let me tell you, folks, **Make Hollywood Great Again**—it’s not just a slogan; it’s a masterpiece, a blockbuster, bigger than any sequel you’ve ever seen. Hollywood’s been around for over a century, longer than most of your favorite actors have been alive. Incredible, right? It’s an American treasure, a beacon of greatness, just like me. We’re talking the biggest, highest-grossing movies in the world. Nobody does it better than us. Not France, not India, not even Canada—they’re nice, but come on.

But now, folks, **we’ve got a crisis.** A disaster, really. Foreign movies—they’re coming in hot. Bollywood with their three-hour musicals. Korean dramas? So dramatic, so emotional. Japanese anime? Lots of big eyes and wild hair, people love it. And China? They’ve got dragons, martial arts—very flashy. These movies, folks, they’re not just coming for our audiences. They’re coming for our **box office,** our jobs, and, frankly, our popcorn money. It’s like the Oscars all over again—rigged!

Now, here’s the thing: Hollywood’s top people, the big shots, they’re calling me. They’re saying, ‘Mr. Trump, you’re the only one who can fix this.’ And I say, ‘You’re absolutely right.’ So here’s what we’re gonna do, folks. First of all, **we’re building a wall.** A big, beautiful wall for the movie industry. Not a real wall—although wouldn’t that be something? A cultural wall, an economic wall, maybe even a wall of movie trailers—nobody gets through unless they meet **Hollywood standards.** No subtitles, no dubbing, no weird dancing scenes unless it’s a musical. And you can forget about those overly long credits. Tighten it up!

But listen, folks, we’re not just blocking foreign movies. We’re smart, okay? Smarter than those guys. We’re going to attract their audiences. Huge audiences. The best audiences. We’ll make American movies so good they’ll be begging to watch them. Action, romance, superheroes—everyone loves superheroes! We’re talking **‘Avengers: Bigger and Better,’** maybe even a new sequel to *Home Alone.* Macaulay’s still around, right? Tremendous actor.

And here’s the best part: we’ll take what’s great about foreign movies—just the good stuff—and make it ours. Bollywood sparkle, Korean twists, anime dragons, and guess what? **Made in America.** Better, faster, with more explosions. We’ll call it ‘Cinematic Innovation,’ and everyone will say, ‘Wow, Hollywood is back, baby!’

So, folks, it’s not just about shutting out the competition. No, no. It’s about reminding them who’s the boss. Hollywood is America, and America doesn’t lose. Together, we’re going to make the movie industry great again. Believe me, it’s going to be **tremendous.** And you’re gonna love the popcorn!"
