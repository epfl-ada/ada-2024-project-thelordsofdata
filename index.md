# The Call to Action

"Folks, **we’ve got a crisis.** Hollywood’s been around for over a century. We’re talking the biggest, highest-grossing movies in the world. But now, foreign movies—they’re coming in hot. They’re coming for our audiences, our **box office,** and, frankly, our jobs. It’s like the Oscars all over again—rigged!

Now, here’s the thing: Hollywood’s top people, the big shots, they’re calling me. They’re saying, ‘Mr. Trump, you’re the only one who can fix this.’ And I say, ‘You’re absolutely right.’ 

So here’s what we’re gonna do, folks. We’re smart, okay? Smarter than those guys. We’re going take a look at the data and have our experts analyse it. All the past American movies, who's buying them, Americans or foreigners, the influencing factors, everything. And we're going to use all that information to attract those foreign audiences. Huge audiences, all over the world, will watch our movies. **Made in America, baby.**

You better believe it folks! We’re going to outshine, outclass, and outplay every single foreign competitor, and **Make Hollywood Great Again!** "

Words from the former and future convicted President himself. So let's get started.

## Dataset

## Data Sources

The original CMU dataset only contains information on the total revenue generated by the movie, as well as the genre and the tropes of the characters featured within each movie. In order to look at trends in domestic versus foreign revenues, we needed to supplement this data. In addition to the CMU dataset, we used both the 'Movies Box Office Collection Data' dataset from Kaggle and a custom dataset (which includes data from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers) from the following github link 'https://github.com/ntdoris/movie-revenue-analysis.git' to add the columns for production budget, domestic gross and worldwide gross. 

Because our foreign gross represented the result we wanted to analyse, we needed to find more potentially influencing factors. We did so by web scraping from The Numbers for domestic/foreign gross, Rotten Tomatoes for reviews/plot summary, Wikipedia for country/language, and Box Office Mojo for domestic/foreign gross/ratings. We focused on movies with at least 90 counts per year. This left us with 2689 movies from 2000 - 2019

# Fact-checking Mr Trump

We decided to compare movies that generate most of their revenue domestically and internationally. We assign movies that make more than 50 % of their revenue internationally to the red class and the other movies to the blue class. Performing this split, we obtain 1145 movies with a higher foreign percentage and 1544 with a higher domestic percentage. We then compute the profitability of a movie according to the following formula:

```math
Profitability = \frac{Worldwide Gross}{Budget} 
```

{% include profitability_by_class.html %}

The outliers were removed from the box plots. From the box plots we can observe that the class with more than 50 % of their revenue coming from foreign countries has a higher median than the domestic class. However the red class shows a bit more variance. This confirms that movies that generate more of their revenue internationally are more profitable. Therefore Hollywood should focus on catering to an international audience

{% include year_plot.html %}

The outliers were removed. Oh no! The foreign percentage steadily goes up until 2015. Then it starts going down. We need it to keep going up to maximize profits. The main goal of our analysis is to determine the factors influencing the foreign percentage.

## Influencing Factors

We've decided to look at the following factors:

- Date of Release (Year, Month)
- Genre
- Reviews (Audience, Critics)
- Ratings
- Budget
- Total Revenue
- Runtime

The result we want to look at is:
- Foreign revenue (gross, percentage)

# Data Exploration

- Took inflation into consideration

## Budget
{% include budget_foreign.html %}

The budget is correlated to the foreign percentage. This correlation is statiscally significant significant since the pearson coefficient is 0.33 and the p value is less than 0.05. 

## Genre

{% include domestic_revenue_by_genre.html %}
Top: adventure, fantasy, science fiction, family film
{% include foreign_revenue_by_genre.html %}
Top: adventure, fantasy, science fiction, action
{% include genre_gross.html %}
Foreign > gross top: action, adventure, drama
{% include genre_percentage.html %}
Average, domestic > foreign, but not for fantasy, science fiction, adventure

## Date

## Runtime

## Ratings

{% include profit_rating_count.html %}

Domestic p-value: 0.7284
Foreign p-value: 1.5799e-8 
while ignoring g rating for too low count, found using the Kruskal-Wallis H test as the data is skewed and therefore not normally distributed. It compares the medians of the 3 independent groups.

These p-values tell us that the average profitability of movies that garner more domestic revenue do not seem to be impacted by the movie's ratings, but movies with more foreign revenue are more likely to, due to a highly significant p-value. 

## Reviews 

We took a look at audience and critics reviews of the movies. Perhaps better rated movies fare better internationally?
