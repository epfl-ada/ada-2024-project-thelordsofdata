# Abstract

The film industry has been with us for well over a century and spans all corners of the globe. With the advent of American political and economic power, which has grown through the past century, its soft power has as well. Thanks in large part to the world renowned Hollywood, the highest worldwide grossing movies are made in America. Therefore, we are interested in researching the impact that their rise to worldwide cinema dominance has had on its domestic performance. We hypothesize that throughout the years as English became the 'lingua franca' of the world and Hollywood gained in international popularity, the percentage of revenue coming from foreign countries increased. Furthermore, we would like to determine what movies genres are more successful domestically and with foreign countries. Poring through this data will help determine the key factors needed to realize a worldwide box office hit for major Hollywood studios.

# Research Questions
1. Is there an incentive for American studios to produce movies that attract foreign audiences?
2. How can American studios produce movies that attract foreign audiences in order to maximize profit?
3. How does a movie's production budget impact the domestic/foreign revenue split? Does a larger production budget allow movies to reach a larger foreign audience?
4. What are American preferences in genre, runtime, and ratings, and what are international preferences in those same categories? 
5. What is the impact of the season of release of the movie as well as audience and critic scores on the likelihood of foreign interest?
6. Can we predict which factors will generate a larger foreign audience?


# Dataset

## Budget, Domestic Gross and Worldwide Gross
We started with the CMU movie.metadata dataset. It contains 81740 movies with the following useful  information: Name, Release_Date, Revenue, Runtime and Genres. In order to be able to analyze the Foreign Revenue and Domestic Revenue, we were able to supplement our dataset using a concatenation of information from Kaggle, Box Office Mojo, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and TheMovieDB available at [https://github.com/ntdoris/movie-revenue-analysis](here). We then further augmented our dataset by scrapping information from The Numbers (domestic and foreign gross and genres), Rotten Tomatoes (reviews, ratings, runtime and plot summary), Wikipedia (country), and Box Office Mojo (domestic and foreign gross). Emotional classification of the plot summaries into the seven following categories : suprise, fear, disgust, joy, anger, sadness and neutral was done using Hartman's DistilRoberta model available at [https://huggingface.co/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base](here). All of our USD values were adjusted for inflation to 2024. 

# Methods
## Data preprocessing
### 1. Cleaning the CMU dataset
Within the CMU dataset, the columns that were no longer needed were removed (e.g. the Wikipedia and Free base IDs). Any typos that involved special characters were removed and modifications were made to columns where any unnecessary supplementary information was contained. However, any rows that had NaNs in columns that we required were removed or replaced by information obtained via the scraping method detailed above.

### 2. Supplementing dataset
In order to augment the CMU dataset, we used the scraping method mentioned above which resulted in the addition of additional columns,  of which the most important include budget, domestic gross, foreign gross, and worldwide gross. Any movies that coincided with the CMU dataset were merged together while any new movies were concatenated at the end. The addition of new movies at the end help to bring up the number of movies in our dataset to nearly 2,700.

### 3. Data Exploration
From the augmented dataset, we were then able to explore how some of the different factors (e.g genre, budget, etc...) impacted the domestic and foreign revenue of these movies. We then plotted different variations of how those respective factors impacted revenue.


## Analysis
For our analysis, we used OLS in order to evaluate the correlation between the different factors and revenue. Some of the factors involved came from performing a sentimental analysis on the plot summaries.

### OLS Coefficient 
Now that we have explored at the distribution and relationships between the budget, genre, release date, runtime, rating, reviews, and finally the percentage of foreign revenue of a movie, we can now begin to properly analyse these relationships. We want to know which features predict a higher percentage of foreign revenue by comparing the OLS Coefficient of each feature.

The OLS coefficient represents the expected change in the foreign percentage of revenue for a one-unit increase in the predictor variable, holding all other variables constant. After dropping the columns unrelated to the prediction of the foreign percentage and one-hot encoding the necessary ones, we use a Variance Inflation factor test (VIF) to test for multicolinearity, removing one of the ratings in the process. It's important to look at the p-value associated with the coefficient to determine whether the relationship is statistically significant.

### Sentimental Analysis
In order to determine whether the mood of a movie could have an impact on what appeals to foreign audience, we performed a sentimental analysis on the plot summaries using the method distillroberta. This then defined each plot summary as expressing a certain emotion which was then associated with the relevant movie, and was used when calculating the OLS.
