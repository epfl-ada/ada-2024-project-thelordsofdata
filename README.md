# Abstract

In recent years the world has become increasingly globalized and accessing movies from foreign countries has gotten easier and easier. 

# Research Questions

1. How much does a country's domestic market contribute to the total box office revenue of a movie? Did this change over time?
2. Does a higher population mean that a country will make more of its box office revenue domestically?
3. Does the domestic market of a country fair worse when the country has multiple official languages? Would most of the revenue come from countries that speak the same language as in the movie?
4. How does investment from the government in media and culture impact the global success of the movie?
