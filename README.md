# Abstract

In recent years the world has become increasingly globalized and accessing movies from foreign countries has gotten easier and easier thanks to the internet. We would like to compare the domestic revenue generated by a movie and its global revenue and how that has changed through time. We aim to determine why certain countries have a higher share of domestic revenue. Our hypothesis is that movies from countries with a higher population and fewer official languages performs better domestically. Furthermore, we believe that movies from countries that invest more in media and culture will perform better globally. We will start out research using the CMU movies metadata dataset. This dataset contains metadata infotmation (such as languages, box office revenue, etc...) from 81 741 movies. The data comes from a November 4 2012 dump of Freebase.   

# Research Questions

1. How much does a country's domestic market contribute to the total box office revenue of a movie? Did this change over time?
2. Does a higher population mean that a country will make more of its box office revenue domestically?
3. Does the domestic market of a country fair worse when the country has multiple official languages? Would most of the revenue come from countries that speak the same language as in the movie?
4. How does investment from the government in media and culture impact the global success of the movie?
