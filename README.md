# Abstract

In recent years the world has become increasingly globalized and accessing movies from foreign countries has gotten easier and easier thanks to the internet. We would like to compare the domestic gross generated by a movie and its foreign gross and how that has changed through time. We aim to determine why certain countries have a higher share of domestic gross. Our hypothesis is that movies from countries with a higher population and fewer official languages performs better domestically. We believe these criterias make the movie more accessible to the local population and more locals watching the movies would mean a higher domestic gross. Furthermore, we believe that movies from countries that invest more in media and culture will perform better globally. We will start out research using the CMU movies metadata dataset. This dataset contains metadata infotmation (such as languages, box office revenue, etc...) from 81 741 movies. The data comes from a November 4 2012 dump of Freebase. The research will be supported by additional datasets.   

# Research Questions

1. How much does a country's domestic market contribute to the total box office gross of a movie? Did this change over time?
2. Does a higher population mean that a country will make more of its box office revenue domestically?
3. Does the domestic market of a country fair worse when the country has multiple official languages? Would most of the revenue come from countries that speak the same language as in the movie?
4. How does investment from the government in media and culture impact the global success of the movie?

# Additional Datasets

## Production, Domestic Gross and Worldwide Gross
The CMU dataset only contains information on the total revenue generated by the movie. In order to perform our analysis we found the [INSERT NAME] dataset to add the columns for production, domestic gross and worldwide gross.

## Population of each country
For each of the country that we chose we will obtain the population data from [BEGIN] to [END] 
. This will be used in the time series analysis.

# Methods
## Data preprocessing
### 1. Cleaning the CMU dataset
Remove columns that are not needed for the analysis. Remove rows with NaNs for the revenue, language or countries. Remove special characters from the columns. Modify certain columns to only contain the data that we need (for instance in the languages and countries column, the freebase ID was included but it is not needed in these columns).

### 2. Adding more countries 
In order to have a more balance and fair representation of different countries, we will add more movies from different thriving movie industries around the world. We will also ensure that there is a good representation of different years to make a fair comparaison.

### 3. Adding columns for 'domestic gross', 'foreign gross', 'worldwide gross' and 'production cost'
Using additional datasets we will augment the CMU dataset to contain these 4 essential columns for our analysis.

### 4. Data scrapping
To supplement the missing data we will use the box mojo API to obtain information on domestic gross, foreign gross, worldwide gross and production costs.

### 5. Adding 'percentage_domestic' and 'percentage_foreign'
From the worldwide gross, we will compute the percentage of the worldwide gross that comes from domestic and foreign.

## Analysis

### Bining data
In order to reduce the noise and handle missing data, we have decided to bin the data in groups of
[ENTER YEARS].

### Time Series
We will use different time series to attempt to draw different conclusions. We will first plot the the percentage domestic per country over time to see if there is an increase or not. This will also allow us to see the evolution over time for each country. 

### Correlation
We will then use a scatter plot and the pearson coefficient to try to see if there is a correlation between the the population of the country and the domestic gross percentage. We will generate these plots for each of our time period.

# Brainstorming

CMU dataset: country/languages, mostly US movies, revenue, no budget, ethnicities in Freebase ID, gender/height/name of actors

Ameer/Giada datasets: no country/languages, mostly US, domestic/foreign, can be overlapped with CMU

Additional we can find: population (US and other over time), government investment?

Brainstorming, Storyline suggestion:

We are an American consulting firm and we have several requests from big-name movie producing companies to take a look at the international vs. domestic movie industry. We notice a trend over time of international movie markets increasing, and we would like to ensure America's dominance in the movie industry. We have increasing competition over foreign consumers - we would like to know what we can do to attract this international consumer base compared to what attracts American viewers. We would also like to know why international movies are suddenly stronger competitors.

Potential Analysis we can do:

1. Preferences in genre in US vs World for american movies (rank genres based on foreign revenues vs domestic revenues)
2. Preferences in TV tropes in US vs World for american movies (rank tropes based on foreign revenues vs domestic revenues)
3. More languages = more world audience? for american movies... not gonna give much if it's just american movies
4. domestic vs foreign income, total and percentage, for american movies over time
5. government investment for american movies over time vs domestic income over time
6. budget vs foreign income vs domestic for american movies
7. let's look for movie industry big numbers internationally - market size for countries over time, is america losing its market share

Tasks:

- Adjust ReadMe according to new idea
- Make sure we've really found all the datasets we can that have domestic vs foreign income, maybe with budget too
- Clean & consolidate that (including NaNs - we'll filter per question)
- Find (in order of priority): movie industry market size/market share for countries over time, government investment for US movie industry over time, population over time
- Initial plots can be done for points 1, 2, 4, 6 ASAP
- For point 7, we can find pre-existing online plots to justify ourselves for the time being
- Plots for 3, 5, 7 will need the additional data, and also more brainstorming on what we can do with non-american movies, can come later?
