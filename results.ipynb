    "We started with the CMU movie.metadata dataset. It contains 81740 movies with the following useful  information: Name, Release_Date, Revenue, Runtime and Genres. In order to be able to analyze the Foreign Revenue and Domestic Revenue, we were able to supplement our dataset using a concatenation of information from Kaggle, Box Office Mojo, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and TheMovieDB available at [https://github.com/ntdoris/movie-revenue-analysis](here).   We then further augmented our dataset by scrapping information from The Numbers (domestic and foreign gross and genres), Rotten Tomatoes (reviews, ratings, runtime and plot summary), Wikipedia (country), and Box Office Mojo (domestic and foreign gross).   \n",
    "Emotional classification of the plot summaries into the seven following categories : suprise, fear, disgust, joy, anger, sadness and neutral was done using Hartman's DistilRoberta model available at [https://huggingface.co/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base](here). All of our USD values were adjusted for inflation to 2024. "

    "The plot below demonstrates how popular the respective genres are with each of the respective audiences. The split between the two bars seen below is between movies where a majority of the revenue came from domestic audiences (domestic revenue is greater than 50% of the total worldwide revenue) and those in which the majority of the revenue came from abroad (foreign revenue is greater than 50% of the total worldwide revenue). From the graph, we can see for example that certain genres are more popular with one audience than the other. For example, comedy does much better domestically probably due to cultural and linguistic reasons, while adventure is a genre that captivates a greater share of the foreign audience compared to the domestic audience most likely due to it being much lower on dialogue."

    "The two barcharts below look at each genre and the split between domestic and foreign revenue. The first of the two looks at the nominal cumulative value of the domestic/foreign revenue obtained for all movies in the genre. It can be seen that are big gaps for example in action and adventure, again probably for the reasons talked about above. In the second one, we determine the mean percentage for a given movie of a certain genre on how much revenue will be generated by the local market compared to the foreign market. Once again, foreign audiences seem to prefer movies in the genres mentioned earlier. However, we can that sports and teen movies are much more popular domestically, probably because the themes in them are heavily American (e.g. a sports movie about baseball or a teen movie about the American high school experience)."

We did this in form of boxplots to be able to visualize the distribution of each while including outliers. We also separated between movies that have more than 50% of revenue from domestic, and those that have more than 50% of revenue internationally. This creates a binary comparison between the two for each boxplot. This allows us to compare whether the movies with more international revenue are more affected in some way by the feature. This will be confirmed later in the actual analysis portion."

This meant that for subsequent analysis we can create our models with foreign percentage as a target, without losing any interesting information.\n",
